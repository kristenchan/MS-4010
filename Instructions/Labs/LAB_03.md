# Introduction

By extending declarative agents with actions, you can connect them to external systems and services through their APIs. Connecting an agent to your existing systems can help you automate tasks and get insights using natural language. To improve the user experience, you can use Adaptive Cards to render information that the agent retrieves from APIs in a visually appealing way.

## Example scenario

Suppose you've recently built a declarative agent that integrates with an API of a local restaurant. Using the agent you can browse today's menu and place an order using natural language. The restaurant's API provides a detailed list of dishes, their ingredients, and allergens. You want to enhance the agent's responses by rendering the information about dishes using Adaptive Cards. You also want to render the order summary using an Adaptive Card to provide a visual representation of the order. By using Adaptive Cards, you can include images, text, and buttons to make the information more engaging.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you extend an existing API plugin for a declarative agent to render information that it receives from an API using Adaptive Cards. You learn to:

- **Create**: Create an Adaptive Card template that shows the data from the API.
- **Verify**: Verify that the Adaptive Card template correctly renders API data.
- **Configure**: Configure the API plugin to render the data using the Adaptive Card template.
- **Provision**: Upload your declarative agent to Microsoft 365 Copilot and validate the results.

## Lab Duration

- **Estimated Time to complete**: 35 minutes

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you know how to build Adaptive Card templates for use with declarative agents. You can verify that the templates render the data correctly and configure the API plugin to use the templates.

# Exercise 1 - Download project and build an adaptive card

Let's start by building Adaptive Card templates for the agent to show the data in its responses. To build the Adaptive Card template, you use the Adaptive Card Previewer Visual Studio Code extensions to easily preview your work directly in Visual Studio Code. Using the extension allows us to build an Adaptive Card template, with references to data. At runtime, the agent fills the placeholder with data it retrieves from the API.

### Exercise Duration

- **Estimated Time to complete**: 10 minutes

## Task 1 - Download the starter project

Start by downloading the sample project. In a web browser:

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/microsoft/learn-declarative-agent-api-plugin-adaptive-cards-typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/learn-declarative-agent-api-plugin-adaptive-cards-typescript).
  1. Follow the steps to [download the repository source code](https://docs.github.com/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives#downloading-source-code-archives-from-the-repository-view) to your computer.
  1. Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file and extract it to your **Documents folder**.
  1. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

The sample project is a Teams Toolkit project that includes a declarative agent with an action built with an API plugin. The API plugin connects to an anonymous API running on Azure Functions also included in the project. The API belongs to a fictitious Italian restaurant and allows you to browse today's menu and place orders.

## Task 2 - Build an Adaptive Card for a dish

First, create an Adaptive Card that shows information about a single dish.

In Visual Studio Code:

1. In the **Explorer** view, create a new folder named **cards**.
1. In the **cards** folder, create a new file named **dish.json**. Paste the following contents that represent an empty Adaptive Card:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.5",
    "body": []
  }
  ```

1. Before you continue, from the **Extensions** tab of the activity bar, search for and install the **Adaptive Card Previewer** extension and then create a data file for the Adaptive Card:
  1. Open the command palette by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on the keyboard. Type `>Adaptive` to find commands related to working with Adaptive Cards.

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing commands related to working with Adaptive Cards.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-adaptive-card-commands.png)

  1. From the list, choose **Adaptive Card: New Data File**. Visual Studio Code creates a new file named **dish.data.json**.
  1. Replace its contents with a data that represents a dish:

  ```json
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Caprese Salad",
    "description": "Juicy vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and fragrant basil leaves, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and a touch of balsamic.",
    "image_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnp/copilot-pro-dev-samples/main/samples/da-ristorante-api/assets/caprese_salad.jpeg",
    "price": 10.5,
    "allergens": [
    "dairy"
    ],
    "course": "lunch",
    "type": "dish"
  }
  ```

  1. Save your changes
1. Go back to the **dish.json** file.
1. From the lens, select **Preview Adaptive Card**.

  ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing the Adaptive Card preview.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-adaptive-card-preview.png)

  Visual Studio Code opens a preview of the card to the side. As you're editing the card, your changes are immediately visible on the side.

1. To the **body** array, add a **Container** element with a reference to the image URL stored in the **image_url** property.

  ```json
  {
    "type": "Container",
    "items": [
    {
      "type": "Image",
      "url": "${image_url}",
      "size": "large"
    }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Notice how the card preview automatically updates to show your card:

  ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing the Adaptive Card preview with an image.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-adaptive-card-preview-image.png)

1. Add references to other dish properties. The complete card looks as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.5",
    "body": [
    {
      "type": "Container",
      "items": [
      {
        "type": "Image",
        "url": "${image_url}",
        "size": "large"
      },
      {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "${name}",
        "weight": "Bolder"
      },
      {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "${description}",
        "wrap": true
      },
      {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "Allergens: ${if(count(allergens) > 0, join(allergens, ', '), 'none')}",
        "weight": "Lighter"
      },
      {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "**Price:** â‚¬${formatNumber(price, 2)}",
        "weight": "Lighter",
        "spacing": "None"
      }
      ]
    }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing the preview of an Adaptive Card of a dish.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-adaptive-card-preview-image-properties.png)

  Notice that to display allergens you use a function to join the allergens into a string. If a dish doesn't have allergens, you display **none**. To ensure that prices are properly formatted, you use the **formatNumber** function that allows us to specify the number of decimals to show on the card.

## Task 3 - Build an Adaptive Card for the order summary

The sample API allows users to browse the menu and place an order. Let's create an adaptive card that shows the order summary.

In Visual Studio Code:

1. In the **cards** folder, create a new file named **order.json**. Paste the following contents that represent an empty Adaptive Card:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.5",
    "body": []
  }
  ```

1. Create a data file for the Adaptive Card:
  1. Open the command palette by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS) on the keyboard. Type `>Adaptive` to find commands related to working with Adaptive Cards.

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing commands related to working with Adaptive Cards.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-adaptive-card-commands.png)

  1. From the list, choose **Adaptive Card: New Data File**. Visual Studio Code creates a new file named **order.data.json**.
  1. Replace its contents with a data that represents the order summary:

    ```json
    {
      "order_id": 6210,
      "status": "confirmed",
      "total_price": 25.48
    }
    ```

  1. Save your changes
1. Go back to the **order.json** file.
1. From the lens, select **Preview Adaptive Card**.
1. Next, replace the contents of the **order.json** file with the following code:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.5",
    "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "Order Confirmation ðŸ¤Œ",
      "size": "Large",
      "weight": "Bolder",
      "horizontalAlignment": "Center"
    },
    {
      "type": "Container",
      "items": [
      {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "Your order has been successfully placed!",
        "weight": "Bolder",
        "spacing": "Small"
      },
      {
        "type": "FactSet",
        "facts": [
        {
          "title": "Order ID:",
          "value": "${order_id} "
        },
        {
          "title": "Status:",
          "value": "${status}"
        },
        {
          "title": "Total Price:",
          "value": "â‚¬${formatNumber(total_price, 2)}"
        }
        ]
      }
      ]
    }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Just like in the previous section, you map each element on the card to a data property.

  ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing the Adaptive Card preview of an order.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-adaptive-card-preview-order.png)

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Notice the trailing space after **${order_id}**. This is intentional, because of a known issue with Adaptive Cards rendering numbers. To test it, remove the space and see that the number disappears from the preview.
  >
  > ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing a preview of an Adaptive Card without the order number.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-adaptive-card-preview-no-number.png)

  Restore the trailing space so that your card shows properly and save your changes.

# Exercise 3 - Test the declarative agent with the API plugin in Microsoft 365 Copilot

The final step is to test the declarative agent with API plugin in Microsoft 365 Copilot.

### Exercise Duration

- **Estimated Time to complete**: 10 minutes

## Task 1 - Provision and start debugging debug

In Visual Studio Code:

1. From the **Activity Bar**, choose **Teams Toolkit**.
1. In the **Accounts** section, ensure that you're signed in to your Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft 365 Copilot.

    ![Screenshot of the Teams Toolkit accounts section in Visual Studio Code.](../media/LAB_03/3-teams-toolkit-accounts.png)

1. From the **Activity Bar**, choose **Run and Debug**.
1. Select the **Debug in Copilot** configuration and start debugging using the **Start Debugging** button.  

    ![Screenshot of the Debug in Copilot configuration in Visual Studio Code.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-start-debugging.png)

1. Visual Studio Code builds and deploys your project to your Microsoft 365 tenant and opens a new web browser window.

## Task 2 - Test and review results

In the web browser:

1. When prompted, sign in with the account that belongs to your Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft 365 Copilot.
1. From the side bar, select **Il Ristorante**.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Copilot interface with the Il Ristorante agent selected.](../media/LAB_03/3-copilot-select-agent.png)

1. Choose the **What's for lunch today?** conversation starter and submit the prompt.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Copilot interface with the lunch prompt.](../media/LAB_03/3-copilot-lunch-prompt.png)

1. When prompted, examine the data that the agent sends to the API and confirm using the **Allow once** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Copilot interface with the lunch confirmation.](../media/LAB_03/3-copilot-lunch-confirm.png)

1. Wait for the agent to respond. Notice that the popup on a citation now includes your custom Adaptive Card with additional information from the API.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Copilot interface with the lunch response.](../media/LAB_03/3-copilot-lunch-response.png)

1. Place an order, by typing in the prompt text box: **1x spaghetti, 1x iced tea** and submit the prompt.
1. Examine the data that the agent sends to the API and continue using the **Confirm** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Copilot interface with the order confirmation.](../media/LAB_03/3-copilot-order-confirm.png)

1. Wait for the agent to place the order and return the order summary. Notice, that because the API returns a single item, the agent renders it using an Adaptive Card and includes the card directly in its response.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Copilot interface with the order response.](../media/LAB_03/3-copilot-order-response.png)

1. Go back to Visual Studio Code and stop debugging.
1. Switch to the **Terminal** tab and close all active terminals.

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code terminal tab with the option to close all terminals.](../media/LAB_03/3-visual-studio-code-close-terminal.png)



You want to improve the user experience when working with your declarative agent. Specifically, you want the agent to present the data that it receives from the API in a rich way.

You did some research and found that extending your agent with using Adaptive Cards to render information is suitable for your needs, because:

- It allows you to build on your existing work.
- It gives you control over how the agent presents the data.
- It allows you to present the data in a visually appealing way.
- It allows you to include information beyond the few basic semantic properties that the agent supports.

Previously, when exploring the menu, you had to rely on the textual description of the dish.

By using Adaptive Cards, you can include images, text, and buttons to make the information more engaging. You can also render the order summary using an Adaptive Card to provide a visual representation of the order.
